# Text-Based-Battleship-Game-in-Python
A Python-based text game that simulates the classic Battleship board game. The game is designed to be played in the console without graphical interfaces, allowing players to guess the location of a hidden battleship within a 2D grid. The project emphasizes logical game design, problem decomposition, and text-based visualization of the game board.
